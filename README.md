# Dlithe-internship-Project
Data Science Project
This project focuses on the Bank Note Authentication dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to build and evaluate several classification models to predict whether a banknote is authentic or forged. The project includes basic data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the implementation of multiple classification algorithms.
Classification Models Used are:
   - Decision Tree Classifier
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier
   - Logistic Regression Classifier
   - Random Forest Classifier
   - Gradient Boosting Classifier
